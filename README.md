# Daily-Scheduler

## Description
* Here I updated the starter code given and added more time block divs. Using day.js I formated the day of the week with the date. I created a function in js to loop each time block with the current time to change color depending if the the has past present or future. While updating any text written in the current hour to be saved even after refreshing page.
